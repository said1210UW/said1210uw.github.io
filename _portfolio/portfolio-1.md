Every ten years, each state undergoes redistricting to elect members of Congress. The use of advanced mathematical techniques has empowered map-drawers to gain substantial political leverage. These tools also enable the quantification of partisan favoritism within electoral maps. 

**Project Results**:
- We employed mathematical concepts such as Markov Chains and Spanning Trees to generate and establish over 20,000 alternatives maps
- We created a dataset that overlaps voting results from previous elections and demographic data using GIS mapping software for over 8000 voting precincts
- Finally we employed statistical techniques like ecological inference to establish if racial vote dilution was committed against the Latino community in the Yakima River Valley Area
